# Knead #

## Painless cross-roommate coordination and cost-splitting. ##

## Summary ##
Knead allows housemates to share a single living list of the groceries and homegoods their household requires.
Each person can easily see what is presently needed, what was needed but has been bought, and what their outstanding
share of total costs amounts to. Then, at the end of the month, it tells who to pay whom.

## Problem ##
With roommates, shared goods and shared costs are a two-fold problem. One aspect is logistical: A traditional
"single source of truth" for household errands, like a list pinned to the fridge, is easily ignored, forgotten, or lost,
leading to outstanding needs not being met. Another aspect is social: Roommates may not be proactive about paying for
homegoods that they share, or it might be a confusing and awkward chore to agree upon who owes what.

## Solution ##
Knead aims to address both sides of the inconvenience. By generating and maintaining a single synchronized list across the
devices of housemates, Knead provides an easily-accessible and persistent record of everything any member of the household
has noticed is missing or about to run out. Then, when someone has picked something up, they can mark it as "Bought" to immediately
inform their housemates that the need is addressed. Whoever has purchased the good enters the cash price they fronted, which is
later folded into a calculation of all the household's shared expenses. By presenting the record of needs and purchases as an objective source of truth, Knead alleviates confusions or disagreements about cost-splitting, letting everyone instead square up
and move on with their lives.
